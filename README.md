# music-voter
Requires Python 3.7

This is an application that will allow a group of friends to have control of what music will be played without approaching the host's device and asking to add/change the music 
through a voting system.

While music plays, each friend that is currently listening can vote "YAY" or "NAY" and essentially start playing music closer to what the collective wants to listen to.

This application will be built from Spotify's API but once the concept has been established, this would be expanded to other online music players.
